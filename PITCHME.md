+++
### Acceptance Tests
  * Definition
    * Automated tests ensuring the environment/application is successfully built to allow for manual User Acceptance testing
    * Front end: UI Tests
    * Back end: Smoke/End-to-End Tests

+++
### Acceptance Tests
  * CI Pipeline
    * Acceptance tests come before deploying to UAT/TEST environment
      * Assuming DEV --> UAT --> PRE-PROD environments
    * Acceptance tests can be run in DEV environment
    * Ensures environment/application is up and running for manual user acceptance testing to be performed
    * Automated tests that ensure newly deployed code works in environment

+++
### Back End
  * Smoke Tests
    * Run after deploying new apps/infrastructure
    * Ensures all back end services wire together successfully
      * Oracle, Cassandra, RabbitMQ, Kafka, etc.

+++
### Back End
  * End-to-End Tests
    * Run after new code is deployed
    * Ensures data flows with the right values from beginning to end

+++
### Back End
  * Smoke Test Example
    * Trigger: Deployed application with new database connection URL
    * Test: Test application runs and attempts to query database with JDBC template call
    * Results:
      * Success: Retrieves data from JDBC query - Environment is UP!
      * Failure: Connection refused - Environment is DOWN!

+++
### Back End
  * End-to-End Example
    * Trigger: Deployed application with code changes for calculations
    * Test: Test application initiates data flow with known data and expects correct values to appear at the end of the flow
    * Results:
      * Success: Data retrieved from end of flow has correct value
      * Failure: Data retrieved from end of flow has incorrect value or data does not appear at the end of the flow

+++

### Back End
  * Health Check Endpoint Tests
    * An alternative to Smoke testing
    * Works well on web applications

      * Create a health route which calls each service and posts the status codes to the route.
      * Goes beyond acceptance test functionailty and lends itself well to application support
+++
### Back End
  * Health Check Example
    * Trigger: Deployed application
    * Test: Call the Endpoint and check the response is a 200
    * Results:
      * Success: All service calls return 200 - Results in App is HEALTHY!
      * Failure: If one service returns a 500 - App is SICK!

  * UI Tests
    * TODO
